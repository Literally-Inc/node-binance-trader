  * to track a selection of asset pairs and record all their binance data (candles, depths, trades) into text files

    * the concurrent running trader client.
    * (optional) the NBT Hub a.k.a. [Bitcoin vs. Altcoins](https://bitcoinvsaltcoins.com) to rank your signals.

* a script to run the **client / trader**:
  * to follow and compute the PnL for each received signals

* a script to **backtest** your signals
